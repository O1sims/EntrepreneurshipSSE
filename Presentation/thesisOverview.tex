\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item This dissertation presents theoretical and empirical considerations in the fields of entrepreneurship and power. In doing so, we investigate the interaction between institutions, networks, and entrepreneurship.
\medskip
\item \textbf{Fundamental idea:} The act of entrepreneurship expresses a crucial development of the \emph{social division of labour}. This is reflected in a major modification of institutional environments and interaction infrastructures.
\medskip
\item Investigates the conjecture that entrepreneurial activities lead to new specialisations, \emph{socio-economic roles} and, as a consequence, unique positions in the networked economy.
\medskip
\item \textbf{Current status of dissertation:} Handed in on 8 September 2016. Viva date has been confirmed.
% \begin{itemize}
% \medskip
% \item Unique positions are \emph{uncontested} such that they can lead to exploitation.
% \medskip
% \item However, they are also wealth-generating positions, facilitating deeper divisions of labour and the connection of communities that would otherwise be disconnected.
% \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Aim and objectives}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Aim and objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Aim.} To provide a theory of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity within socially structured economies.
\medskip
\item This consists of four objectives.
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[1.] Develop a network-institutional---or \emph{relational}---perspective of embedded economic activity based on a population of specialised economic agents that form a functional social division of labour.
\medskip
\item[2.] Explain and illustrate the role of the entrepreneur within the relational perspective and highlight the impact that entrepreneurship has on the evolution of the social division of labour.
\medskip
\item[3.] Provide a distinction between the act of entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial function of the economy and relate this to .
\medskip
\item[4.] Complement the theoretical discussion of the relational perspective and entrepreneurship with empirical analyses of entrepreneurial activities.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Dissertation structure}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Dissertation structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item The analysis of entrepreneurship within a relational perspective is partitioned into three consecutive Parts:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[\textbf{Part I.}] Develops a theory of economic interaction, wealth-generation and entrepreneurship within a \emph{socially structured economy}.
\medskip
\item[\textbf{Part II.}] Investigates entrepreneurial activity and positional power in an economy consisting of a horizontal division of labour.
\medskip
\item[\textbf{Part III.}] Investigates entrepreneurial activity and positional power in with more complex interaction structures and a vertical division of labour.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item Throughout we complement theory with empirical examples; this includes the analysis of elite Florentine families and the directorate network of New York City during the early Twentieth Century.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Overview of Part I}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Part I overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Part I provides a set of fundamental notions that define the relational perspective. From this we descirbe the notion of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurial activity.
\medskip
\item This Part results in:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[1.] Definition of socially structured economies given a relational perspective of social and economic activity.
\medskip
\item[2.] Development of consumer-producers, socio-economic roles, and the division of labour.
\medskip
\item[3.] Clarity regarding the definition and impact of entrepeneurship and the entrepreneurial function within this framework.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item This is expressed over three chapters.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Toward a relational perspective}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Chapter 1: Toward a relational perspective}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relational perspective is developed using an axiomatic method: this chapter discusses these underlying modelling axioms and hypotheses.
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[\textbf{Axiom I.}] Bounded rationality: Limited cognitive abilities to compute the consequences of their own and others actions. This
results into fundamental perceived uncertainty in the economy.
\medskip
\item[\textbf{Axiom II.}] Harmonisation of production and consumption: Economic agents are bearers of consumptive needs as well as productive abilities.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item Fundamental notions are derived from these axioms.
\medskip
\item These include: (1) Economic agents as consumer-producers; (2) Socio-economic roles and specialisations; (3) Embeddedness, governance systems, and institutions; and (4) Interaction infrastructures as networks.
% \medskip
% \item Socio-economic roles play an important part when discussing the economic interaction, social division of labour, and the impact of entrepreneurship.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Economic agents are identical and defined as consumer-producers, possessing both consumption and production functions consisting of increasing returns to specialisation over the set of economic goods.
\medskip
\item The production sets can be seen diagrammatically below.
% Insert visuals of production sets.
\medskip
\item The assumption of strict IRS leads to the theorem that given a population of $> 1$ economic agents and no transaction costs, each agent always has an incentive to specialise.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item To engage in functional wealth-generating interaction each agent adopts a specialisation and with it a socio-economic role.
\medskip
\item A socio-economic role expresses an agents \emph{embeddedness} in a well-defined governance system.
\medskip

\draw (10,0) node[minimum size=2em,circle,fill=blue!20] {$R_{i}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\medskip
\item A socio-economic role is a reflection of the governance system ($\Lambda$) that an agent exists within: includes behavioural rules, cultural norms, media that are associated with specialisations.
\medskip
\item Economic agents adopt a socio-economic role through either \emph{adaptive specialisation} or \emph{objective specialisation}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The fundamental problem of the Core needs to be resolved through the use of institutional mechanisms.
\end{itemize}
\medskip

\draw (10,11.5) node[minimum size=2em,circle,fill=yellow!20] {\textbf{SS}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Due to the problem of the Core economic agents are considered as \emph{centrifugal} forces and the governance system as a \emph{centripetal} force.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The formation of economic relationships leads to a global social structure termed as an \textbf{interaction infrastructure}.
\medskip
\item An interaction infrastructure refers to a tuple consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[1.] A population of consumer-producers; and
\medskip
\item[2.] A set of functional bilateral economic interactions and relationships formed between the population of consumer-producers.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item Interaction infrastructures are represented as \emph{networks}.
\medskip
\item Leads to the modelling Lemma regarding the positional attributes of economic agents: Economic agents have a relational position within an interaction infrastructure. These positional attributes are derived from the economic interactions they form with others.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Growth \& development of the socio-economic space}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Chapter 2: Growth \& development of the socio-economic space}
\begin{itemize}
\item All economic relationships and interactions are socially embedded and exist within some well-defined space. We term this interaction space as a \textbf{socio-economic space}.
\medskip
\item A socio-economic space refers to a given set of economic agents engaged in a well-described collection of general economic interactions that operate under a well-defined collection of media and institutions.
\medskip
\item As such the socio-economic space contains economic agents, interaction infrastructures, and a governance system guiding the formation of these relationships.
\medskip
\ietm This chapter provides an overview of the socio-economic space and, with it, an analysis and simulation of its growth and development through adaptive specialisation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{../Images/structure-space.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item There exists a two-way relationship between the population of economic agents, their relational position within the economy, and the set of institutions in the governance system.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The socio-economic space is defined in a formal manner as a mathematical concept. Allows us to discuss these concepts in a more well-defined way.
\medskip
\item For a given collection of media and institutions, a socio-economic space can be represented by a pair $(N, \mathcal{G})$ where $N = \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is a given set of economic agents and
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{S}(N) \cup \mathcal{H}(N)
\end{equation*}
is a given collection of \textbf{general economic interactions} on $N$, where
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{S}(N) = \{ S ~ \mid ~ S \subset N \mbox{ and } S \neq \varnothing \}
\end{equation*}
is the family of non-empty coalitions in the population $N$, representing \textbf{lateral} economic interactions on $N$, and
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{H}(N) = \bigcup_{k = 2}^{\infty} N^{k}
\end{equation*}
is the class of all finite ordered sequences of economic agents, representing authority chains or \textbf{hierarchical} economic interactions in $N$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Whilst discussing the evolution of the socio-economic space we distinguish the notions of growth and development.
\medskip
\item The \textbf{growth} of a socio-economic space refers to a change in some fundamental or pre-existing parameters that define the socio-economic space such that the aggregate utility of all economic agents increases.
\medskip
\item The \textbf{development} of a socio-economic space refers to a productive change in the elements of the governance system and its derived structure such that the new institutional mechanisms, for example, produces an increase in aggregate utility.
\medskip
\item \textbf{Decline} and \textbf{regression} are polar notions to growth and development.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item We simulate growth of the socio-economic space through adaptive specialisation.
\medskip
\item A number of simulations are provided. Each simulation differs in a number of factors:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[1.] The production abilities/technologies of the economic agents in the outputs considered; and
\medskip
\item[2.] The exchange mechanisms considered that characterise the socio-economic space.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item Simulations define two environments within which economic agents operate. These environments are informed through different exchange mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[1.] Egalitarian exchange economy: Supply-side only; and
\medskip
\item[2.] Cournot-Nash exchange economy: Prices are determined through demand and supply-side pressures.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame} %\frametitle{}
% Insert images of interaction infrastructures
\begin{itemize}
\item The institutional mechanisms dictate the resulting structure of the network, the positions of economic agents, and aggregate welfare within the socio-economic space.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Entrepreneurship \& the entrepreneurial function}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship \& the entrepreneurial function}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the division of labour is at the centre of the relational perspective, then its evolution is of major importance in our discussion.
\medskip
\item We have discussed many of the attributes the socio-economic space: the fundamental elements, including consumer-producers, governance system, and interaction infrastructures; and the foces within the space, including guidance, networking and embeddedness.
\medskip
\item However, we have still yet to talk about entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial function: definition and illustration is the purpose of this chapter.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a socio-economic space with a population of economic agents and a governance system of socioeconomic institutions.
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item An \textbf{entrepreneur} is an economic agent who, through her actions, engages in entrepreneurship.
\medskip
\item \textbf{Entrepreneurship} refers to actions that modify in a major way elements of the governance system and the underlying interaction infrastructure in the socio-economic space, thus directly or indirectly impacting the population of the socio-economic space.
\medskip
\item The \textbf{entrepreneurial function} refers to actions that modify in a minor way elements of the socio-economic space, thus directly impacting the individual economic agent and her local environment.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item Entrepreneurship is considered as a ``higher form'' of adaptive specialisation, leading to new roles that become embedded and thus subject to objective specialisation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given the definition of the entrepreneur and the simulations in the previous chapter we make the following conjecture:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Through a process of entrepreneurship an economic agent creates a new socio-economic role. This role carries unique positional
attributes within the interaction infrastructure it exist within.
\medskip
\item
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item This definition of entrepreneurship is related to established theoretical perspectives, but does not fit traditional models of `ocupational choice'.
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Schumpeter (1912, 1935, 1942): New product and process innovations faciliate the emergence of new specialisations and roles.
\medskip
\item Baumol (1990): Entrepreneurship can be either `productive`, `unproductive` or `destructive`. Depends on institutional environment.
\medskip
\item Henrekson and Sanandaji (2011): Entrepreneurs can abide by, evade or alter institutions.
\medskip
\item Burt (1992, 2004, 2010): Entrepreneurs possess and exploit superior social capital through the leveraging of information.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Entrepreneurship in a Platonian Economy}

\subsection{Overview of Part II}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Part II overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Part I developed the relational perspective and noted the impact the entrepreneurs have on the institutional environment. Part II analyses the relationship between entrepreneurs, network position, and power.
\medskip
\item This Part results in:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[1.] A set of tools in which to measure entrepreneurial power in networks. This is based on the agents unique position and the connectivity of their environment.
\medskip
\item[2.] A game theoretic model in which to understand entrepreneurship as a coalitional act.
\medskip
\item[3.] Application of these tools to empirical examples; in particular the elite Florentine marriage and exchange network.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item This is expressed over two chapters.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Middlemen as entrepreneurs}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Chapter 4: Middlemen as entrepreneurs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Entrepreneurial agents possess unique positions within an interaction infrastructure.
\medskip
\item Centrality tools have been developed to look at nodes that are in ``the thick of things'' (Freeman, 1977). These concentrate on the links that nodes have in the network, the eigenvector of the network, the geodesic paths that they exist on, etc.
\medskip
\item These tools do not highlight the unique positions of entrepreneurial agents. We develop a set of measures that to measure the power of a agent through:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item[a.] The inability for other agents to \emph{contest} the entrepreneurs position;
\medskip
\item[b.] The walks that the entrepreneurial agent can \emph{exploit}; and
\medskip
\item[c.] The \emph{robustness} of their unique position.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item All analysis is generalised to directed graphs and therefore the tools developed have no specific application to economic scenarios \emph{per se}.
\medskip
\item Can be used in sociology or information theory to investigate the transfer of knowledge or flow and potential manipulation of information.
\medskip
\item We apply these measures of power and robustness to the marriage network of elite Florentine families and to Krackhardt's managerial advice network.
\medskip
\item The rise of the Medici can be attributed to their unique position in their social network; in particular, their ability to broker relationships between opposing factions in Florence.
\medskip
\item However, their position is not robust relative to other powerful elite families, such as the Pazzi.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item With the tools developed we highlight the powerful brokerage opportunities, which the Medici took advantage of. These emerged due to the inherent ``network disjunctures within the elite'' (Padgett and Ansell 1993, p. 1259).
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{../Images/Florentine-marr.png}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\subsection{The formation of extractive structures in networks}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Chapter 5: The formation of extractive structures in networks}
\begin{itemize}
\item The tools developed in the previous chapter relate to the positional power of individual entrepreneurial agents. It does not consider the network as a structure that can evolve out of strategic decision-making.
\itemize
\item The insights in the previous chapter are generalised to consider coalitions of agents that can attain entrepreneurial power within a given network structure.
\itemize
\item Agents can effectively manipulate the interaction infrastructure in a major way in an effort to reduce their contestability and/or increase their robustness.
\itemize
\item We use game theory in conjunction with graph theory to provide a measurement of entrepreneurial power from group activity.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Again, we apply these measures to empirical examples of two evolving networks:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] The marriage network of elite Florentine families; and
\medskip
\item[2.] The network of 9/11 terrorists from 1999--2001.
\end{medskip}
\medskip
\item \textbf{Appendix:} The algorithmic solution to the `blocking problem' discussed in this Chapter is applied to problems of vaccination and network decompartmentalisation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
