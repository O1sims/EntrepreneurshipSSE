	Review = {REVERSAL OF FORTUNE: GEOGRAPHY AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD INCOME DISTRIBUTION* DARON ACEMOGLU SIMON JOHNSON JAMES A. ROBINSON Among countries colonized by European powers during the past 500 years, those that were relatively rich in 1500 are now relatively poor. We document this reversal using data on urbanization patterns and population density, which, we argue, proxy for economic prosperity. This reversal weighs against a view that links economic development to geographic factors. Instead, we argue that the reversal reflects changes in the institutions resulting from European colonialism. The European intervention appears to have created an "institutional reversal" among these societies, meaning that Europeans were more likely to introduce institutions encouraging investment in regions that were previously poor. This institutional reversal accounts for the reversal in relative incomes. We provide further support for this view by documenting that the reversal in relative incomes took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage of the opportunity to industrialize. I. INTRODUCTION This paper documents a reversal in relative incomes among the former European colonies. For example, the Mughals in India and the Aztecs and Incas in the Americas were among the richest civilizations in 1500, while the civilizations in North America, New Zealand, and Australia were less developed. Today the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia are an order of magnitude richer than the countries now occupying the terri- tories of the Mughal, Aztec, and Inca Empires. * We thank Joshua Angrist, Abhijit Banerjee, Olivier Blanchard, Alessandra Cassella, Jan de Vries, Ronald Findlay, Jeffry Frieden, Edward Glaeser, Herschel Grossman, Lawrence Katz, Peter Lange, Jeffrey Sachs, Andrei Shleifer, Fabrizio Zilibotti, three anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the All-Univer- sities of California History Conference at Berkeley, the conference on "Globaliza- tion and Marginalization" in Bergen, The Canadian Institute of Advanced Re- search, Brown University, the University of Chicago, Columbia University, the University of Houston, Indiana University, Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy, National Bureau of Economic Research summer institute, Stanford Univer- sity, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University for useful comments.

	Abstract = {We construct a model of simultaneous change and persistence in institutions.
	The model consists of landowning elites and workers, and the key
	economic decision concerns the form of economic institutions regulating
	the transaction of labor (e.g., competitive markets versus labor
	repression). The main idea is that equilibrium economic institutions
	are a result of the exercise of de jure and de facto political power.
	A change in political institutions, for example a move from nondemocracy
	to democracy, alters the distribution of de jure political power,
	but the elite can intensify their investments in de facto political
	power, such as lobbying or the use of paramilitary forces, to partially
	or fully offset their loss of de jure power. In the baseline model,
	equilibrium changes in political institutions have no effect on the
	(stochastic) equilibrium distribution of economic institutions, leading
	to a particular form of persistence in equilibrium institutions,
	which we refer to as invariance. When the model is enriched to allow
	for limits on the exercise of de facto power by the elite in democracy
	or for costs of changing economic institutions, the equilibrium takes
	the form of a Markov regime-switching process with state dependence.
	Finally, when we allow for the possibility that changing political
	institutions is more difficult than altering economic institutions,
	the model leads to a pattern of captured democracy, whereby a democratic
	regime may survive, but choose economic institutions favoring the
	elite. The main ideas featuring in the model are illustrated using
	historical examples from the U.S. South, Latin America and Liberia.},

	Abstract = {We present a non-technical account of ambiguity in strategic games
	and show how it may be applied to economics and social sciences.
	Optimistic and pessimistic responses to ambiguity are formally modelled.
	We show that pessimism has the effect of increasing (decreasing)
	equilibrium prices under Cournot (Bertrand) competition. In addition
	the effects of ambiguity on peace-making are examined. It is shown
	that ambiguity may select equilibria in coordination games with multiple
	equilibria. Some comparative statics results are derived for the
	impact of ambiguity in games with strategic complements.},

	explains major experimental regularities of common pool resource
	(CPR) experiments. The evidence indicates that in standard CPR games
	without communication and without sanctioning possibilities inefficient
	excess appropriation is the rule. However, when communication or
	informal sanctions are available appropriation behavior is more efficient.
	Our analysis shows that these regularities arise naturally when a

@unpublished{Tessone:2010p2459,
	Abstract = {Based on the empirical analysis of the dependency network in 18 Java
	projects, we develop a novel model of network growth which considers
	both: an attachment mechanism and the addition of new nodes with
	a heterogeneous distribution of their initial degree, {\$}k_0{\$}.
	Empirically we find that the cumulative degree distributions of initial
	degrees and of the final network, follow power-law behaviors: {\$}P(k_{0})
	\propto k_{0}^{1-\alpha}{\$}, and {\$}P(k)\propto k^{1-\gamma}{\$},
	respectively. For the total number of links as a function of the
	network size, we find empirically {\$}K(N)\propto N^{\beta}{\$},
	where {\$}\beta{\$} is (at the beginning of the network evolution)
	between 1.25 and 2, while converging to {\$}\sim 1{\$} for large
	{\$}N{\$}. This indicates a transition from a growth regime with
	increasing network density towards a sustainable regime, which revents
	a collapse because of ever increasing dependencies. Our theoretical
	framework is able to predict relations between the exponents {\$}\alpha{\$},
	{\$}\beta{\$}, {\$}\gamma{\$}, which also link issues of software
	engineering and developer activity. These relations are verified
	by means of computer simulations and empirical investigations. They
	indicate that the growth of real Open Source Software networks occurs
	on the edge between two regimes, which are either dominated by the
	initial degree distribution of added nodes, or by the preferential
	attachment mechanism. Hence, the heterogeneous degree distribution
	of newly added nodes, found empirically, is essential to describe
	the laws of sustainable growth in networks.},
